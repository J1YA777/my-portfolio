# My Portfolio Website

**Date Created:** November 16, 2025

This is my **personal portfolio website**, which includes the following sections:

- **About Me** – Profile, hobbies, skills, and interests  
- **Everyday Blog** – Daily or weekly reflections on learning, coding, and projects and everything else 
- **Coding Projects** – Showcase of coding projects with links  
- **Competitions Tracker** – STEM/academic competitions with dates, status, and certificates  
- **Research Projects** – Summaries of STEM research or experiments, with images or PDFs  

The website is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with dynamic content managed via **Netlify CMS**. Content is stored in this repository and can be updated through the admin panel without editing the code directly.  

I planned, organized, and structured this portfolio myself; most of the code was generated with the help of AI.
