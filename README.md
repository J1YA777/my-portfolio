# My Portfolio Website

This is my **personal portfolio website**, which includes the following sections:

- **About Me** – Profile, hobbies, skills, and interests  
- **Everyday Blog** – Daily or weekly reflections on learning, coding, and projects  
- **Coding Projects** – Showcase of coding projects with screenshots and links  
- **Competitions Tracker** – STEM/academic competitions with dates, status, and certificates  
- **Research Projects** – Summaries of STEM research or experiments, with images or PDFs  

The website is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with dynamic content managed via **[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)**. Content is stored in this repository and can be updated through the admin panel without editing the code directly.  

AI tools were used to help generate and structure the code for this website.
